# Schreiber 2018 GiantSteps MTG Tempo Annotations

This folder contains tempo annotations derived by Schreiber and Müller for **a subset** of the
[GiantSteps MTG Key](https://github.com/GiantSteps/giantsteps-mtg-key-dataset) dataset.
These tempo annotations are available in
[this archive](http://www.tagtraum.com/download/schreiber_tempo_cnn_ismir2018.zip)

Note that these tempo annotations were originally meant for training, not for testing.
They have not been verified.

The original GiantSteps MTG Key dataset was created by Ángel Faraldo.
