# Schreiber 2018 LMD Tempo Annotations

This folder contains tempo annotations derived for the original
[Lakh MIDI Dataset](https://colinraffel.com/projects/lmd/) (LMD) by Schreiber and Müller.
These tempo annotations are available in [this archive](http://www.tagtraum.com/download/schreiber_tempo_cnn_ismir2018.zip)

Note that these annotations were originally meant for training, not for testing.
They have not been verified. Some of the tracks have been annotated with genre tags using
annotations from [here](http://www.tagtraum.com/msd_genre_datasets.html).
Track names are [MSD](http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/) ids.

Colin Raffel's LMD is available at https://colinraffel.com/projects/lmd/
