# Böck 2019 / Hockman 2012 Beat and Tempo Annotations

This folder contains beat and tempo annotations imported from
Sebastian Böck's [repository](https://github.com/superbock/ISMIR2019).

We assume the beat annotations stem from Hockman et al. 2012.
We are uncertain how the tempo annotations were generated.

If you use these annotations, please cite the following paper:    

Jason Hockman and Matthew E.P. Davies and Ichiro Fujinaga,
